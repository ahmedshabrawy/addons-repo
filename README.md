## About

Home Assistant allows anyone to create add-on repositories to share their
add-ons for Home Assistant easily. This repository is one of those repositories,
providing extra Home Assistant add-ons for your installation.

The primary goal of this project is to provide you (as a Home Assistant user)
with additional, high quality, add-ons that allow you to take your automated
home to the next level.
